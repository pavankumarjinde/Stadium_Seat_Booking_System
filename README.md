# Stadium_Seat_Booking_System
This research work was carried out because we believe that there are significant improvements that could be made to the current stadium seat booking system 
which would benefit the national stadium management team, saving them time and money, as well as the customers, the fans, 
who would find it easier to purchase and use their tickets, leading to an altogether more enjoyable match day experience, and, hopefully, more frequent visits to the stadium. 
The National Stadium Management team is responsible for the day-to-day management and running of the stadium. 
Buying tickets in person is by far the easiest way to purchase tickets, however many fans live outside of the area, or cannot get down to the stadium to purchase tickets in advance due to work.
To easy stadium seat booking task, there is need for a software system which must be created using well established principles of software engineering and 
latest technologies that guarantee a high degree of reliability and enhance ways of buying elsewhere, hopefully a larger number of people would buy in advance,
easing the congestion.
The main aims of the project are to create a reliable and easy to use system which will simplify the stadium seat booking processes. A more 
efficient and modern entry system to the ground, which will reduce costs on a match-by- match basis. And to provide a fairer system for distributing away tickets.
